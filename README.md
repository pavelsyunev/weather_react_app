# Simple weather react app based on free Open Weather API. 

App automatically detect user location with free https://geolocation-db.com/ service. If user use any add block or geolocation service can't detect user location, default location will be New York.

## Graphic design

Application graphic design follow Success Academies websites main design patterns. I used square containers to split and show main information. Orange is main color for current weather, Gray color is used for additional information like forecast data.

## Application design

Application has simple structure based on four main components and two utils functions. Each component responsible for own data. On the first start App component fetching user location information. If geolocation is not available, function pass default location - New York. Next we get weather data  with Open weather API for current day and forecast data, save it to App component state. App component pass weather data as props to Current weather component and to Forecast weather component. Based on this information react render components.

## Testing

Because application is pretty simple and straightforward I didn't use any special test. We just need to be sure that we fetch correct information and pass it as props to child components. While fetching user see Loading message. After fetching is done we show main component with weather data.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run ->

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
